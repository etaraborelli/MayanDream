    What is Mayan Dream?
  </h3>
  <p>
    In Mayan Dream you can get a little idea about the sophisticated mayan calendar, and the different energies that describe each day. These energies also gives us a clue about what is our 
    purpose in this life, which tools we have, and how to interact with the rest of the energies.

    For more information about the wonderful world of the mayan calendar, you can visit the Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%27in">here</a> 
    or the site <a href="http://mayankin.com/">MayanKin</a> (from where I took most of the information displayed here, with the approval of its owner, Mariela Maya).
