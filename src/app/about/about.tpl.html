    What is Mayan Dream?
  </h3>
  <p>
    In Mayan Dream you can get a little idea about the sophisticated mayan calendar, and the different energies that describe each day. These energies also gives us a clue about what is our 
    purpose in this life, which tools we have, and how to interact with the rest of the energies.

  <p>
    For more information about the wonderful world of the mayan calendar, you can visit the Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%27in">here</a> 
    or the site <a href="http://mayankin.com/">MayanKin</a> (from where I took most of the information displayed here, with the approval of its owner, Mariela Maya).
